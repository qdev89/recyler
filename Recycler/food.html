                        From food waste for food assistance. There are in Denmark destroyed thousands of
                        tons of good, edible food that could have been eaten. All though an invistigation
                        by the Labour Movement showed that in Denmark alone, 300,000 people live below the
                        OECD poverty line. Additionally, we have approximately 5,000 homeless people in
                        Denmark and the number of poor is increasing in step with the social services are
                        cut. It's not embarrassing to give good food you have in excess, to the homeless
                        and the socially excluded - it is a good deed.

                        You can donate for example, unopened canned foods, unopened juice, vacuum packed
                        and unopened food (which has been stored correctly), etc. Not food that is past
                        its sell-by date. Many individuals, businesses, retailers, restaurants, caterers
                        and caterers have already begun to donate their good and fresh surplus food to the
                        homeless.

                        stomachs. Take a picture of your apple tree, your plum trees, or whatever you grow
                        and which others could get joy of. Place it on recycleworld and wait for others
