                        previously non-recyclable or hard-to-recycle waste. Anyone can sign up for these
                        programs, called the Brigades, and start sending us waste.<br> <br>
                        TerraCycle then converts the collected waste into a wide variety of products and
                        materials. With more than 20 million people collecting waste in over 20 countries
                        TerraCycle has diverted billions of units of waste and used them to create over
                        1,500 different products available at major retailers ranging from Walmart to Whole
                        Foods Market. <br> <br>
                        Our goal is to eliminate the idea of waste by creating collection and solution systems
                        for anything that today must be sent to a landfill. <br> <br>
                        Founded in 2001 by Tom Szaky, then a 20-year-old Princeton University freshman,
                        TerraCycle began by producing organic fertilizer, packaging liquid worm poop in
                        used soda bottles. Since then TerraCycle has grown into one of the fastest-growing
                        green companies in the world.
