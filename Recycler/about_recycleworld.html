                            Recycleworld was created in Denmark by Bjarke Steen Rasmussen summer 2012, after
                            a financial crisis had left many economies in shambles and we still heard about
                            a planet with increasing pressure on resources - there was a need for a new mindset.
                            Bjarke Steen Rasmussen resides in Skive, Denmark and the municipality's slogan "Clean
                            living" inspired to look at society's consumption patterns and opportunities to
                            help in the immediate environment as well as the remote environment. Our goal is
                            to revolutionize the recycling thinking and minimize much unnecessary food waste.
